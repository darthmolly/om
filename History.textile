  "HYDRA-395":https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/HYDRA-395: Fixed bug that prevented you from appending term values with apostrophes in them

h2. 1.1.0

HYDRA-371: Provide a way to specify a term that points to nodes where an attribute is not set

  Add support for this syntax in Terminologies, where an attribute value can be :none.  When an attribute's value is set to :none, a not() predicate is used in the resulting xpath 

    t.computing_id(:path=>"namePart", :attributes=>{:type=>:none}) 
    
    will result in an xpath that looks like:
    
    //namePart[not(@type)] 

namePart[not(@type)]
